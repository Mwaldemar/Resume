### Development of this online resume / CV - _(Still in progress)_

**_I will keep refining this resume. Future updates will, among other things, include cross-device usability (Right now its only setup for desktop). Furthermore, i will also be adding more projects that i will be working on after finishing this site._**

I’m building an online resume/CV to showcase my skills and experience in web development. I really enjoy frontend development and it's a big dream of mine to work with frontend development. The project’s been a great opportunity to practice using React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript, all while creating a functional and stylish site that I can use for job applications.

The main goal is to create a clean, professional design, but also to play around with different components, functionality and effects. I have implemented global theming so that the entire site maintains a consistent look in terms on color. Additionally, I’ve set up media queries that will be implemented in the future, ensuring the site will adapt perfectly across all devices, including mobile, tablet & desktop.

To demonstrate my knowledge of TypeScript, I’ve been using objects to map most of my data, such as experience, skills, and projects. This helps to keep the code clean, organized, and type-safe, making it easier to manage and update in the future.

The goal is to create an online presence that not only reflects my technical abilities but also serves as a professional portfolio for potential employers, and that's why i will keep adding projects to this website, that will give a little taste of what i have been working on (potentially with a few pictures).

One of the metrics i will keep optimizing for is the lighthouse score; Right now it scores really well on the "main"-page (home) and the "lower" accessibility score is due to the contrast of the blue color on the off-white color, which i will not do anything about.

So far, it’s a great learning experience, and I look forward to further optimize the site and add more features.
