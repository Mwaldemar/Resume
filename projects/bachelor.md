### Overall objective: Improve conversion rate for Trendhim through category breakdown

During my bachelor project, my team and I set out to increase the conversion rate on the Trendhim website by optimizing the category pages. Our approach involved breaking down the categories into smaller, more manageable sections by incorporating widgets that would guide users to find their desired products faster. These widgets were designed with a masculine aesthetic to align with the preferences of Trendhim’s customer base, ensuring that the design would resonate with the target audience.

Our project began with multiple iterations of design in Figma, where we focused on creating intuitive, visually appealing widgets. We started with informal testing, gathering feedback from friends and family to identify potential issues and areas for improvement. Based on this feedback, we made initial design tweaks to refine the widgets and improve the overall user experience.

Once we had a more polished version, we took a more data-driven approach by testing the design in a lab setting with eye-tracking technology. This allowed us to observe how users interacted with the category pages and the widgets, ensuring that our design was not only visually appealing but also functional. The feedback from this session was overwhelmingly positive, and it validated our approach of guiding users to products in a more structured way, making product discovery faster and easier.

With these insights, we finalized the design and moved forward with the implementation. The key challenge was ensuring that the design catered to Trendhim’s primarily male audience, so we focused on bold typography, clean lines, and a layout that felt both modern and masculine without overwhelming the user. The widgets were aimed at simplifying the browsing experience and serve as a way of breaking down the categories, so that the users would be presented with only the relevant products.

In the picture above you can see the initial category page view. All the filtering options were implemented, also on mobile in a sidepanel as seen in the picture below.

While a lot of the functionality was already a part of Trendhim's website, we still wanted to implement it, to have a "fully"-functioning prototype, that would combine all these functionalities into one experience. In the picture below you can see the mobile view after the filter options from the picture above was applied.

Finally, the main component that we made for our bachelor project, the widget, can be seen below. It was scattered through the category and guided the users to find products based on the preferences.

Furthermore, we developed an accompanying business plan, that were to highlight the potential gains by implementing this.
